                             Manhattan federal court that accuses OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT.O) of misusing books the authors have written to train the models behind OpenAI's
                             popular chatbot ChatGPT and other artificial-intelligence based software. <br><br>
                            The writers, including Pulitzer Prize winners Taylor Branch, Stacy Schiff and Kai Bird - who co-wrote the J. 
                            Robert Oppenheimer biography "American Prometheus" that was adapted into the hit film "Oppenheimer" this year - told the court on Tuesday that the companies infringed their copyrights by using their work to train OpenAI's GPT large language models.
